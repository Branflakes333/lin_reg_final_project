        <h2>Introduction: Why Care About Regression Beyond OLS?</h2>
        <p> 
            Making predictions is one of the most powerful things we can do to make the most out of data. 
            If we are looking at some sample data and believe that we can make predictions on a target data point, linear regression is the way to go. 
            Linear regression is a statistical method of modeling and estimating the relationship between one or more variables in some data 
            (called predictors) to generate a prediction. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is how we choose the estimators to generate our model. 
            We obtain these estimators by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the estimated predictions and actual values (called residuals).
            Here is the OLS equation for simple linear regression (one predictor):
        </p>
        <p>
            $$\hat y = X\beta+\epsilon$$
        <p> 
            Our goal is to find a line of best fit that will minimize the residuals between our predicted data and the line.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            OLS, however, only creates single point estimates for our data. 
            There really is not a great way to model probability distributions on those estimates, 
            or in other words - observing the level of uncertainty around the estimates we have come up with. 
            This is where our discussion of Bayesian regression will come in. 
        </p>
        <h2>Why Linear Regression Doesn't Always Get the Job Done</h2>
        <p> 
            One of the biggest limitations with linear regression is that it performs poorly on samples with low sample size. 
            It is not uncommon to work with data in which each data point costs a significant portion of your funding. 
            This results in not a lot of data in your sample. 
            The ramifications of a small sample size is that inferences of the linear model are statistically unsound and/or useless. 
            To draw inference through tools such as hypothesis testing or confidence intervals, 
              we must be able to assume that the error term is approximately normal (and all other assumptions hold true). 
            With a small sample size, we cannot apply the central limit theorem to assume approximate normality in the error. 
            Furthermore, with a small sample size, the standard error blows up. 
        </p>
        <p>
            $$SE(\hat\beta)^2 = \text{var}(\hat\beta)=\sigma^2(X^TX)^{-1}$$
        </p>
        <p>
            With a small sample size, $\small X^TX$ is nearly singular, which then makes its inverse blow up. Hence, the standard error blows up as well. The consequence is that it becomes effectively impossible to reject the null hypothesis of any test because the realm of possibility of the null hypothesis is so wide. Ignoring inference is also not a good idea because slightly different data with cause our estimated coefficients to change drastically.

        <h2>
            What Bayesian Regression does Differently
        </h2>
        <p> 
          The power of Bayesian regression lies in the prior. 
          The prior is the mathematical representation of our prior beliefs about our data before observing our sample. 
          In the case of Bayesian regression, we can have a prior that the coefficients are zero. 
          This means that the data must provide sufficient evidence to prove otherwise. 
          This works very well with small samples because, unless the data are very extreme, 
            it will not be able to sway the estimated coefficients away from the priorâ€”especially when there are not many data points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider an example where we think there might be a correlation between some random variables $X$ and $y$. 
          Suppose that in truth, there is no correlation. 
          Under OLS regression, the estimated model will fit some non-flat line due to being unable to see the true correlation in the sampling noise. 
          Because we have our prior assumption that the true coefficient of  $X$ $X$ is zero, 
            our Bayesian model does a very good job fitting close to the true function, 
            since the small dataset couldn't disprove our prior because the sampling noise wasn't statistically powerful.

        <h2>
            What is Bayesian Regression
        </h2>
        <p>
	        Baye's Theorem, when applied to linear regression, infers the probability distribution for the parameters, given new evidence. 
            This means that as data changes/evolves we can challenge our prior beliefs, using Bayesian Regression as our framework. 
        </p>

        <p>
          There are a few drawbacks, however, to consider when thinking about using Bayesian Regression. One issue is computational 
          power. For a model with a large number of parameters, it takes a significant amount of computing power to calculate Bayesian 
          distributions for each of the estimates. Estimating posterior distributions requires using methods such as Markov Chain Monte 
          Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC approximates posteriors by using thousands of random samples to eventually reach the most optimal 
          distribution. This is known as a Markov chain. As the parameters grow, the time complexity of constructing a large Markov chain 
          grows significantly which can slow down computing time. When working with huge models, this is definitely something important to consider.
